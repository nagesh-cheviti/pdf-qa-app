The Monkey and the Fruit Seller
In a bustling village market, a clever monkey watched a fruit seller arranging his vibrant, juicy
produce. The monkey, craving the sweet mangoes, waited for the perfect moment. As the fruit seller
turned his back to attend to a customer, the monkey darted in, snatched a ripe mango, and leapt up
into a tree. The fruit seller shook his fist in the air, half-angry, half-amused, as the monkey grinned
from above, savoring his victory with each bite.
The next day, the fruit seller came prepared. He set aside a mango on a separate mat, away from
the main stall. When the monkey returned, he went for the decoy mango. The fruit seller quickly
trapped him under a basket. But seeing the monkey's pleading eyes, the seller released him with a
laugh and tossed him a mango. From then on, the monkey visited daily, and the fruit seller left a
mango out for his little visitor, forming an unlikely friendship.
